I have an Apple TV 2g with XBMC and I was looking for a tool that could download trailers from youtube in order to watch them with XBMC. I couldn't find so I developed it.<br>
It's pretty straightforward.<br><br>
0-Download and install Microsoft Framework 4.0<br>
1-Select the main folder (In the below case, select Movie):<br>
<blockquote>sample:<br>
<blockquote>-Movie<br>
-Movie/Salt 2010<br>
<br>
<bR><br>
<br>
<br>
-Movie/Avatar 2010<br>
<br>
<bR><br>
<br>
</blockquote></blockquote>

2-Inform if the tool is going to use folder name or file name as search criteria (the tool always use the name plus the word "trailer")<br>
3-Select your prefer quality order (The tool only download the first link from youtube).<br>
4-Enjoy!<br><img src='http://www.spiritofadventure.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/DownloadTrailers.jpg'><br>
